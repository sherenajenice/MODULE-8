# ðŸŽ“ Hackerrank:Python Program to Find Students with the Second Lowest Grade

This program reads student names and their corresponding grades, identifies the **second lowest grade**, and prints the names of all students who have that grade in **alphabetical order**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program to:
- Read a list of students and their grades.
- Identify the second lowest grade.
- Print the names of students who have that grade, sorted alphabetically.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Read** an integer `n` representing the number of students.
2. **Read** each studentâ€™s name and grade, and store them as a sublist inside a list.
3. **Extract** all the grades and sort them.
4. **Identify** the second lowest grade from the sorted grade list.
5. **Collect** names of all students whose grade matches the second lowest grade.
6. **Sort** the names alphabetically.
7. **Print** each name on a new line.

## ðŸ’»  Program

students = [
    ("Alice", 85),
    ("Bob", 75),
    ("Charlie", 90),
    ("David", 75),
    ("Eva", 80),
    ("Frank", 85)
]

grades = [grade for name, grade in students]

unique_grades = sorted(set(grades))  # Remove duplicates and sort the grades

second_lowest_grade = unique_grades[1]  

students_with_second_lowest = [name for name, grade in students if grade == second_lowest_grade]

students_with_second_lowest.sort()

print("Students with the second lowest grade:")

for student in students_with_second_lowest:

    print(student)

## Output
Input                              
 [("Alice", 85),
    ("Bob", 75),
    ("Charlie", 90),             
    ("David", 75),
    ("Eva", 80),
    ("Frank", 85)]

Result
 [("Alice", 85), ("Bob", 75), ("Charlie", 90), ("David", 75), ("Eva", 80), ("Frank", 85)]
 
## Result
The program was succesful.
